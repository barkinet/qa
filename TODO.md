# TODO!

A list of features and functionality that need adding.
Vary both in size and scope.
Some of these are currently in embedded TODOs. Most are not.

## Posts (both question & answers)

* Staff can edit any post (not reputation based)
* Users can edit their own posts
* Votes should be locked after a certain amount of time.
* Clicking on a vote score should display the up/down split
* Max post length should be a site configuration setting
* Site configuration of an array of 'banned URLs' (e.g URL shorteners) which
  will cause a validation error.

## Questions

* Limit the length of titles used for the slug

## Answers

* If you have already answered a question the insert form is hidden and you are
  asked if you actually want to create another answer or edit existing.
* Errors in answers should be handled.

## Comments

* ...
* pretty self explanatory

## Users

* add more authentication methods - username/password & social login

## Tags

* The 'questions tagged' view should allow scoping of questions by more than
  one tag.

## Misc

* Add some sort of rubocop (sp?) to the project
* The DB seed should include a 'changelog' (and this should be maintained
  in CHANGELOG.md).
