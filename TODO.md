A list of features and functionality that need adding.
Vary both in size and scope.
Some of these are currently in embedded TODOs. Most are not.

## Global
* Rate limiting

## Posts (both question & answers)

* Users can edit their own posts
* Votes should be locked after a certain amount of time.
* Clicking on a vote score should display the up/down split
* Site configuration of an array of 'banned URLs' (e.g URL shorteners) which
  will cause a validation error.
* Search

## Questions

* Limit the length of titles used for the slug
* Add sorting options for questions

## Answers

* If you have already answered a question the insert form is hidden and you are
  asked if you actually want to create another answer or edit existing.
* Errors in answers should be handled.
* Answers below a given score should be greyed out
* Add pagination and sorting for answers

## Comments

  one tag.
